## Overview

This is a desktop website for a mock landing page for a business called Chunkopop.
Special thanks to [Dominic Walls ](UX-UI designer) for the awesome design, invaluable input, and well organized figma project.

### The challenge

- Develop a React landing page designed by one of our fellow UX design apprentices.

## My process

- walk through and understand figma design with the designer(Dominic).
- select tools and technologies.
  - React scroll - for smooth scrolling to specific section.
    material ui slide- for image carousel
  - material ui icons- cart and search icons
- breakdown the design in to components and create reusable component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [material UI](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Scroll](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/intro)

### What I learned

Working with UX/UI designer is a great experience. we were able to look at a design together allowing time to ask questions and discuss the functions of certain feature.

Having access to a live figma project takes all the guess work out of sizing elements or typeface. Inspecting elements on figma lets you look at generated code, especially very helpful for things like gradients.

I took the opportunity to practice new method to import external font family, apply material Ui for arrow icons for the carousel on "release of the day section".
